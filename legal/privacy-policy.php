    AFTT Limited, New Zealand (hereinafter referred to as "AFTT") is committed to protecting your privacy online or otherwise, and the success of our business depends on maintaining our customers' trust. This privacy policy is intended to provide a summary of the types of personal information we collect from our customers, how we use, transmit/disclose, and store this information.

    Personal information is collected when customers apply for an AFTT trading account (including a demo account) and during any communication with AFTT representatives throughout the process. AFTT will limit the personal information collected to what is necessary to provide you with the products and services you require.
  </p>
  <p class="text--body">
    AFTT may also collect other information from time to time, such as through customer surveys used for research and feedback purposes, to continuously improve the quality of the services and products we offer. Personal information collected online may be combined with other information provided to AFTT by the customer via physical copies or other sources and may also be collected indirectly through monitoring or other means, such as recording phone calls and monitoring emails. 
    In these instances, AFTT will not review information continuously or routinely, but it may be used for compliance or security purposes.
  </p>
  <p class="text--body">
    Traffic pattern information includes details about the web pages users visit, the number of users frequently using our website and/or trading platforms, etc. This information is anonymous and can only be used in aggregate form.

      By providing us with personal information related to third parties (e.g., but not limited to, information about your spouse, children, and/or parents), you declare and warrant that you have obtained the third party's consent to collect, use, and/or disclose the personal information as listed herein.
