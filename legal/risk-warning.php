                            <p class="text--body"><i>A summary of products and services and the associated risks</i></p>
                            <p class="text--body">Investing in financial products involves risks. Generally, you should only trade in financial products that you are familiar with and understand the associated risks. Before making investment decisions, you should carefully consider your financial situation and consult independent professional advisors to determine whether the investment is suitable for you.</p>

                            <h3 class="heading--section">Securities</h3>
                            <p class="text--body">Securities prices can sometimes be highly volatile. The prices of securities can rise and fall, and may even become worthless. Trading in securities may not necessarily generate profit; instead, it may lead to losses.</p>

                            <h3 class="heading--section">Futures and Options</h3>
                            <p class="text--body">The risk of loss in trading futures contracts or options is substantial. In certain circumstances, you may sustain a loss greater than the amount of margin you initially deposited. Even if you place contingent orders, such as "stop-loss" or "stop-limit" orders, these orders may not necessarily limit your losses. Market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders. You may be required to deposit additional margin within a short time frame. If you fail to meet the required amount within the specified time, your open positions may be liquidated. You will be liable for any resulting deficit in your account. Therefore, you should thoroughly understand and consider whether such trading is suitable for you based on your financial status and investment objectives before trading. If you decide to trade options, you should understand the specific exercise and expiration procedures and your rights and obligations upon exercise or expiration.</p>

                            <h5 class="heading--5">Futures</h5>
                            <p class="text--body">Futures trading involves the trading of contracts on the future price movement of specific underlying assets. Futures contracts obligate the holder to buy or sell the corresponding asset at a fixed price on a specific future date. For example, the underlying asset could be raw materials, agricultural products, or financial instruments. Depending on the nature of the futures contract, assets must be settled either by difference or by actual delivery on the settlement date. AFTT does not support physical delivery. Futures are always traded on margin (see above "Forex Trading"). Futures trading is conducted in regulated markets, either directly within an exchange's trading system or through reporting trades.</p>

                            <p class="text--body">Please note that because futures are traded on margin, you may hold larger positions relative to your available funds at AFTT. Consequently, relatively small negative or positive market fluctuations can have a significant impact on your investment. Thus, the risk associated with futures trading is relatively high. This means that even with relatively small margin deposits, the potential returns can be substantial. However, if the total risk of your margin trading exceeds your margin deposits, you may incur losses that exceed your margin deposits.</p>

                            <p class="text--body">The following brief explanation discloses some, but not all, of the risks associated with futures trading and other important aspects. Futures trading is not suitable for the general public. You should carefully consider whether such trading is appropriate for you based on your personal experience, objectives, financial resources, and other relevant circumstances:</p>
                            <ol class="ml-4">
                                <li class="text--body"><i>Leverage Effect</i><br>
                                Futures trading carries a high level of risk. Because the amount of margin required to open a futures position is relatively low compared to the value of the futures contract itself, leverage can magnify both gains and losses. Even small market fluctuations can have a large impact on the funds you have invested or will need to invest. Therefore, this leverage effect can work both for and against you. You may lose all your initial margin and any additional funds deposited to maintain your position. If the market moves against your position or margin levels are increased, you may be required to deposit additional funds on short notice to maintain your position. If you fail to pay additional funds within the specified time, your position may be liquidated at a loss, and you will be responsible for any resulting deficit.</li>

                                <li class="text--body"><i>Risk of Reducing Orders or Strategies</i><br>
                                Lowering risk trading orders or strategies may not be as effective as intended. For example, placing orders like "stop-loss" or "stop-limit" to limit losses may not work because market conditions may prevent the execution of such orders. The risks of employing certain strategies using combinations of positions, such as "spreads" and "straddles," may be as high as the risks of taking simple "long" or "short" positions.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h5 class="heading--5">Options Contracts</h5>
                            <p class="text--body">Options trading is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk, making it unsuitable for all investors. Buyers and sellers of options contracts should understand the type of options they intend to trade (e.g., put or call options, buy or sell options) and the associated risks. Options contracts are traded with AFTT as the counterparty.</p>
                            <p class="text--body">Options contracts give you the right or obligation to buy or sell a specific quantity or value of a particular underlying asset at a fixed strike price before or on a specified expiration date. A call option gives you the right to buy, while a put option gives you the right to sell.</p>
                            <p class="text--body">Options contracts that are in-the-money at expiration will automatically be exercised.</p>
                            <p class="text--body">Options trading involves significant risk. Buying options (buying call options or put options) may result in a total loss of your initial investment (i.e., the premium and transaction costs). Selling options (selling call options or put options) can lead to large (potentially unlimited) losses. To ensure that you can cover the losses from selling options, AFTT will require you to post margin. However, potential losses can exceed the margin collected, and you will be responsible for these losses.</p>
                            <p class="text--body">If the total risk of your margin trading exceeds your margin deposits, your losses may exceed your margin deposits. If the underlying asset of an options contract is a margin-traded product (i.e., a derivative) and the options contract is exercised by the buyer, the buyer (in the case of a call option) or the seller (in the case of a put option) will obtain a position in the underlying margin-traded product and be subject to the corresponding risks and margin requirements.</p>

                            <h5 class="heading--5">Stock Options</h5>
                            <p class="text--body">The final settlement of stock options requires the physical delivery of the underlying stock rather than cash settlement of the strike value. If a client holds a stock options position but does not have enough cash or stock, they will not be able to settle the options position and will fail to fulfill their contractual obligations.</p>
                            <p class="text--body">When the holder of a long options position exercises their right to buy or sell the underlying stock on or before the expiration date, the stock options position will be finally settled. At expiration, all in-the-money long options positions held by AFTT clients are automatically exercised. Customers holding short options positions will be assigned via random selection both before and at expiration. The "assumed" procedure should not be used to settle short options positions at expiration. Broker clearing statements should reflect the true outcome of options expiry trades.</p>
                            <p class="text--body">Generally, AFTT clients are responsible for meeting the settlement requirements associated with their options positions. Therefore, AFTT will not take preemptive action to avoid settlement failures for client positions. Clients are responsible for managing their positions, especially as expiration approaches, to ensure they can meet any settlement obligations. However, if AFTT faces unsecured client losses, AFTT reserves the right to take preemptive action to close out some or all of the client's positions that may result in potential losses, which cannot be covered by the account balance. Preemptive liquidations will be carried out by AFTT's Market Analysis and Control Department.</p>
                            <p class="text--body">If a client fails to meet their settlement obligations, AFTT will act on behalf of the client to resolve the settlement failure issue without prior notice. AFTT will purchase the required stock at market price to settle short stock positions, liquidate any or all positions to settle short cash positions, and liquidate any long options positions used to cover short options positions. In exchange-traded options, this is known as default processing. Additional (substantial) commissions will be charged for transactions executed for default processing. Default processing will be executed by AFTT's Market Service Desk.</p>
                            <p class="text--body">Therefore, clients should carefully consider closing out positions before expiration.</p>

                                <li class="text--body"><i>Variable Risk Levels</i><br>
                                Options trading carries a very high level of risk. Investors, whether purchasing or selling options, should understand the type of options they intend to trade (i.e., put or call options) and the associated risks. You should calculate how much the options value must increase to make the position profitable, considering the options premium and all transaction costs.</li>

                                <li class="text--body"><i>Terms and Conditions of Contracts</i><br>
                                You should inquire about the terms and conditions of the specific futures or options contracts you are trading and the corresponding obligations (e.g., in what circumstances you may be required to fulfill or deliver the underlying asset of the futures contract, the expiration date of the options, and the time limits for execution). In certain circumstances, exchanges or clearinghouses may modify the specifications of outstanding contracts (including options strike prices) to reflect changes in the underlying asset.</li>

                                <li class="text--body"><i>Suspension or Limitation of Trading and Pricing Relationships</i><br>
                                Market conditions (e.g., lack of liquidity) and/or the operation of certain market rules (e.g., suspension of trading in any contract or contract month due to price limits or circuit breakers) may make it difficult or impossible to execute trades or close/offset positions, increasing the risk of loss. If you experience this after selling options, the risk of loss may increase.</li>

                                <li class="text--body"><i>Deposited Cash and Assets</i><br>
                                You should fully understand the protections afforded to funds or other property deposited in the form of cash or other assets for domestic or overseas trading, particularly in the event of company insolvency or bankruptcy. The amount of funds or property you may recover could be limited by specific legislation or local rules. In some jurisdictions, assets identified as your property may be proportionately distributed like cash to cover potential shortfalls.</li>

                                <li class="text--body"><i>Commission and Other Charges</i><br>
                                Before you begin trading, you should obtain a clear understanding of all commissions, fees, and other charges you will incur. These charges will affect your net profit (if any) or increase your loss.</li>

                                <li class="text--body"><i>Transactions in Other Jurisdictions</i><br>
                                Transactions executed in markets in other jurisdictions (including those formally linked to domestic markets) may expose you to additional risks. The protection afforded to investors under the rules of these markets may differ or be reduced. Before trading, you should inquire about any rules related to the specific transaction. Your local regulatory authority cannot compel the enforcement of the rules of the jurisdiction or market where your transactions were executed. Therefore, you should ask the firm with which you are trading about the remedies available in your jurisdiction and other jurisdictions before trading.</li>

                                <li class="text--body"><i>Currency Risk</i><br>
                                Profits and losses from transactions in foreign currency-denominated contracts (whether executed in your jurisdiction or another) will be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates when converting contract currency to another currency.</li>

                                <li class="text--body"><i>Trading Facilities</i><br>
                                Electronic trading facilities are supported by computer-based components for the order routing, execution, matching, registration, or clearing of trades. As with all facilities and systems, they are subject to temporary disruption or failure. Your compensation for losses may be subject to the liability limits of the system provider, market, clearinghouse, and/or participating firm. These limitations may vary, so you should inquire about the details from the firm with which you are trading.</li>

                                <li class="text--body"><i>Electronic Trading</i><br>
                                Transactions conducted through an electronic trading system may differ from transactions conducted through other electronic trading systems. If you trade through an electronic trading system, you will be exposed to risks associated with the system, including the risk of hardware or software failure. System failures may result in your trade orders not being executed according to your instructions or not being executed at all.</li>

                                <li class="text--body"><i>Over-the-Counter Transactions</i><br>
                                In some jurisdictions and only under specific circumstances, firms are permitted to conduct over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. The firm with which you are trading may be acting as a counterparty to the transactions you conduct. In such cases, it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate existing positions, assess their value, determine a fair price, or assess the risk. Therefore, these transactions may carry greater risks. In addition, OTC transactions may be less regulated or subject to a different regulatory regime; therefore, you should fully understand the applicable rules and associated risks before engaging in such transactions.</li>

Options trading is not suitable for the general public. You should carefully consider whether such trading is appropriate for you based on your personal experience, objectives, financial resources, and other relevant circumstances:</p>
							<ol class="ml-4">
							    <li class="text--body"><i>Variable Risk Levels</i><br>
							        Options trading carries a very high level of risk. Investors, whether purchasing or selling options, should understand the type of options they intend to trade (i.e., put or call options) and the associated risks. You should calculate how much the options value must increase to make the position profitable, considering the options premium and all transaction costs.</li>
							    <p class="text--body">Options buyers can offset or exercise the options, or allow the options to expire. Exercising the options may result in cash settlement or the buyer obtaining or delivering the underlying equity. If the options are based on a futures contract, the buyer will obtain a futures position and will be subject to related margin obligations (see "Futures" section above). If the options purchased are worthless at expiration, you will lose your entire investment, including all options premium and transaction costs. If you intend to purchase out-of-the-money options, please note that the likelihood of profit is usually small.</p>
							    <p class="text--body">Selling (i.e., "writing" or "granting") options usually involves more risk than buying options. Although the premium received by the seller is fixed, the seller may incur losses exceeding that amount. If the market moves against the seller, they will need to deposit additional margin to maintain the position. Sellers also face the risk of the buyer exercising the options, and the seller is obligated to settle the options in cash or obtain or deliver the underlying equity. If the options are based on a futures contract, the seller will obtain a futures position and will be subject to related margin obligations (see "Futures" section above). The risk may be reduced if the options are "covered" by holding a corresponding position in the underlying equity, futures contract, or other options. If the options are not covered, the risk of loss may be unlimited.</p>
							    <p class="text--body">Certain jurisdictions' exchanges allow for delayed payment of the options premium, limiting the buyer's risk to the cost of the premium. However, the buyer remains at risk of losing these costs and transaction fees. When options are exercised or expire, the buyer must pay any outstanding premium costs at that time.</p>
							</ol>
							
							
							<p class="text--body"><u>Additional Common Risks of Forex and Derivative Trading (Including Futures and Options)</u></p>
							<ol class="ml-4">
							    <li class="text--body"><i>Contract Terms and Specifications</i><br>
							        You should inquire with the firm through which you are trading about the specific terms and specifications of the futures or options contracts you are trading, as well as the corresponding obligations (e.g., under what circumstances you may be required to fulfill or deliver the underlying equity of a futures contract, and the expiration date and time limits for the exercise of options). In some cases, exchanges or clearinghouses may modify the specifications of outstanding contracts (including options strike prices) to reflect changes in the underlying equity.</li>
							
							    <li class="text--body"><i>Suspension or Restriction of Trading and Pricing Relationships</i><br>
							        Market conditions (e.g., lack of liquidity) and/or the operation of certain market rules (e.g., suspension of trading in any contract or contract month due to price limits or circuit breakers) may make it difficult or impossible to execute trades or close/offset positions, increasing the risk of loss. If you experience this after selling options, the risk of loss may increase. In addition, the normal pricing relationship between the underlying equity and the futures, or between the underlying equity and the options, may not exist. For example, futures options are subject to price limits, but the options themselves are not. A lack of reference prices for the related asset may make it difficult for investors to determine what constitutes "fair value."</li>
							
							    <li class="text--body"><i>Deposited Cash and Assets</i><br>
							        You should fully understand the protections afforded to funds or other property deposited in the form of cash or other assets for domestic or overseas trading, particularly in the event of company insolvency or bankruptcy.

							<h3 class="heading--section">Forex (Foreign Exchange / FX)</h3>
							<p class="text--body">In forex trading, investors focus on the price movement of one currency relative to another, meaning selling one currency while buying another. For example, if an investor expects the US dollar to appreciate against the British pound, they may sell pounds to buy dollars.</p>
							<p class="text--body">Forex trading is a leveraged product, meaning you can open larger positions in the market with a relatively small amount of capital. Forex can be traded as spot forex, forward forex, or forex options. Spot forex involves buying one currency and selling another for immediate delivery. Forward forex and forex options involve settlement on a future agreed date at the price agreed upon on the trade date. Forward forex trading involves an obligation to trade at the agreed price on the settlement date. If the forex option price is more favorable than the market price at that time, the buyer of the forex option has the right to trade the underlying spot forex currency pair on the expiry date. On the other hand, if the buyer demands it, the option seller is obligated to trade with the buyer (AFTT) on the settlement date. Therefore, the risk involved in buying options is limited to the premium paid at contract signing, while the risk in selling options is unlimited, depending on the price movement of the underlying spot forex currency pair.</p>
							<p class="text--body">The forex market is the largest financial market globally, trading 24 hours a day on weekdays. One of its characteristics, compared to other products, is its relatively low profit margin. Therefore, to achieve substantial profits, a large trading volume is necessary, such as in the margin trading mentioned above. In forex trading, the profit of one market participant is always offset by the loss of another participant. Forex trading is always conducted with AFTT as the counterparty, with AFTT quoting prices based on those available in the market.</p>
							<p class="text--body">Please note that because forex is traded on margin, you can hold larger positions based on your funds at AFTT. Consequently, relatively small negative or positive market fluctuations can significantly impact your investment. Thus, the risk associated with forex trading is relatively high. This means that even with relatively small margin deposits, the potential returns can be substantial. However, if the total risk of your margin trading exceeds your margin deposits, your losses may exceed your margin deposits.</p>
							<p class="text--body">The risk of loss in trading leveraged forex can be substantial. You may lose more than your initial margin deposit. Even if you set contingent trading orders, such as "stop-loss" or "stop-limit" orders, these may not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts. Market conditions may prevent the execution of such orders. You may be required to deposit additional margin within a short time frame. If you fail to provide the required amount within the specified time, your open contract positions may be liquidated. You will be responsible for any resulting deficit in your account. Therefore, you must carefully consider your financial situation and investment objectives to determine whether trading is suitable for you.</p>
							
							<h3 class="heading--section">Forex Options</h3>
							<p class="text--body">Selling forex options involves special risks and can result in significant losses for investors like you. Therefore, this strategy may not be suitable for all clients and is primarily intended for experienced investors.</p>
							<p class="text--body">Please note the following situations:</p>
							<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">An options seller may short a contract and then find that the demand for the contract increases, driving up the premium price, <u>even if the underlying asset has not moved, potentially leading to significant losses.</u></li>
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">If the option price increases, the seller may <u>incur significant losses</u> due to factors including, but not limited to:
							    <ul>
							       <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">The price of the underlying asset</li>
							       <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">The strike price</li>
							       <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">The time remaining until expiration</li>
							       <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">The volatility of the underlying asset</li>
							   </ul>
							</li>
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">All options are marked to market. This means that when you sell an option:
							    <ul>
							       <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">The cash balance in your account will increase.</li>
							       <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">The unrealized value of your positions will decrease according to the real-time price of the options.</li>
							       <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">Therefore, the account value will not increase when a new short options contract is initiated.</li>
							   </ul>
							</li>
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">Compared to buying options, selling options generally involves <u>greater risk and usually less reward.</u></li>
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">Naked option selling (uncovered or unhedged) involves the risk of <u>unlimited losses</u>.
							    <ul>
							       <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">When selling a naked call option, theoretically, the price of the underlying asset can rise indefinitely, leading to unlimited losses in your trading account.</li>
							       <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">When selling a naked put option, theoretically, the price of the underlying asset can fall to zero, resulting in significant losses in your trading account.</li>
							   </ul>
							</li>
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">The seller of a European-style option can only be assigned during the exercise period.</li>
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">In the event of a <strong>margin call</strong>, the margin required in your account exceeds the margin equity.
							    <ul>
							       <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">The system will forcibly close all margin positions (including long-only options).</li>
							       <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">Given our self-directed trading business model, we do not guarantee contact via phone and/or email before the system forces a liquidation.</li>
							       <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">Your positions may be forcibly closed by the system even if you have initiated a fund transfer.</li>
							   </ul>
							</li>
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">When the market moves against your position, the losses on short option positions can be substantial and may result in a deficit balance in the account, which should be paid immediately.</li>
							</ol>
							<p class="text--body">Selling forex options is only suitable for experienced investors who understand the risks, have the financial capability and willingness to bear potentially significant losses, and have sufficient liquid assets to meet applicable margin requirements. In this regard, if the value of the underlying instrument moves against the open short options position, AFTT may require substantial additional margin payments or forcibly close investor accounts with little or no prior notice in accordance with the General Business Terms.</p>
							
							<h3 class="heading--section">GEM Stocks</h3>
							<p class="text--body">Investing in Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) stocks involves high risks. Some companies listed on GEM may not have a track record of profitability or may not be obligated to forecast future profitability. GEM stocks can be highly volatile and illiquid.</p>
							<p class="text--body">Be sure to make investment decisions after appropriate and prudent consideration. Due to the higher risks and other characteristics of GEM, it is more suitable for professionals and other experienced investors.</p>
							<p class="text--body">To obtain the latest information on GEM stocks, you may only be able to access it on the website operated by The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. GEM companies are generally not required to publish paid announcements in the gazette.</p>

							<h3 class="heading--section">Overseas Listed Investment Products</h3>
							<p class="text--body">Overseas listed investment products must comply with the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction where they are listed. Before trading overseas listed investment products or authorizing others to trade on your behalf, you should understand the following:</p>
							
							<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">Since overseas listed investment products will operate under different regulatory regimes, you should understand the level of investor protection and safeguards available in the relevant overseas jurisdiction.</li>
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">Differences between the overseas jurisdiction and Hong Kong's legal system may affect your ability to recover funds.</li>
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">You may be subject to tax implications, currency risks, and additional trading costs, as well as counterparty and broker-dealer risks.</li>
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">The political, economic, and social developments affecting the overseas market in which you are investing.</li>
							</ol>
							<p class="text--body">These risks and others may affect the value of your investment. If you do not understand or cannot bear such risks, you should not invest in the product.</p>
							<p class="text--body">This statement does not disclose all the risks and other significant aspects of trading overseas listed investment products. You should only trade such products if you understand and can bear the level of risk you are exposed to.</p>
							<p class="text--body">You should carefully consider whether trading is suitable for you based on your personal experience, objectives, risk tolerance, financial resources, and other relevant circumstances. When considering whether to trade or authorize others to trade on your behalf, you should note the following:</p>
							
							<h5 class="heading--5"><u><i>Differences in Regulatory Regimes</i></u></h5>
							<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">Overseas markets may operate under different regulations and may function differently from authorized exchanges in Hong Kong. For example, different rules may govern the custody of securities and funds held by custodian banks or trustees. This may affect the level of safeguards in place to ensure the proper segregation and safekeeping of your investment products or overseas funds. If a custodian faces credit problems or bankruptcy, your investment products or funds may not be protected. Overseas markets may also have different trade clearing and settlement periods. This may affect the information available to you regarding trade prices and the timing of trade settlements in such overseas markets.</li>
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">Compared to Hong Kong, overseas markets may operate under different rules, providing different levels of investor protection. Before you start trading, you should fully understand the remedies available to you in Hong Kong and other relevant jurisdictions (if any).</li>
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">Overseas listed investment products may not be subject to the same disclosure standards applicable to investment products listed or quoted on an authorized exchange in Hong Kong. Differences in disclosure, accounting, auditing, and financial reporting standards may affect the quality and comparability of the information provided. Additionally, it may be more challenging to find the latest information, and the information released may only be available in a foreign language.</li>
							</ol>
							<h5 class="heading--5"><u><i>Differences in Legal Systems</i></u></h5>
							<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha" start="4">
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">In some countries, legal concepts used in mature legal systems may not yet exist or have not yet been tested by the courts. This makes it difficult to predict the outcome of judicial proceedings with certainty, even in cases of a favorable ruling, and the amount of damages that might be awarded.</li>
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">The Securities and Futures Commission cannot compel the regulatory authority or market in the jurisdiction where the affected transaction took place to enforce the relevant rules.</li>
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">The laws of some jurisdictions may prohibit or restrict the repatriation of funds from that jurisdiction, including capital invested in that country, withdrawal proceeds, profits, dividends, and interest. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that the funds you invest and the funds generated from your investments can be repatriated.</li>
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">Some jurisdictions may also limit the number or types of investment products foreign investors can purchase. This may affect the liquidity and price of overseas listed investment products in which you invest.</li>
							</ol>
							<h5 class="heading--5"><u><i>Different Costs Involved</i></u></h5>
							<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha" start="8">
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">Investing in overseas listed investment products may involve tax issues. For example, sales proceeds or any dividends and other income received may be subject to taxes, duties, or fees in both the overseas jurisdiction and Hong Kong.</li>
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">If you need to convert the currency in which the investment product is denominated into another currency, your investment returns on the foreign currency-denominated investment product may be affected by exchange rate fluctuations or possibly by foreign exchange controls.</li>
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">When trading on an overseas exchange, you may incur additional costs, such as handling fees and broker commissions. In some jurisdictions, you may also be required to pay certain premiums to trade specific listed investment products. Therefore, before you begin trading, you must clearly understand all the commissions, fees, and other charges you will incur. These charges will affect your net profit (if any) or increase your loss.</li>
							</ol>
							<h5 class="heading--5"><u><i>Counterparty and Broker-Dealer Risks</i></u></h5>
							<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha" start="11">
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">Trades on overseas exchanges or markets are typically executed by AFTT through foreign brokers who have trading and/or clearing rights on those exchanges. All transactions executed under your instructions with these counterparties and brokers depend on their proper fulfillment of their obligations. The insolvency or default of such counterparties and brokers may result in positions being liquidated or closed out without your consent, and/or may make it difficult for you to recover funds and assets held overseas.</li>
							</ol>
							<h5 class="heading--5"><u><i>Political, Economic, and Social Developments</i></u></h5>
							<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha" start="12">
							<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">Overseas markets are influenced by the political, economic, and social developments in the overseas jurisdictions, which may be uncertain and may increase the risk of investing in overseas listed investment products.</li>
							</ol>
							
							
							<h3 class="heading--section">Receiving Client Assets Outside Hong Kong</h3>
							<p class="text--body">Client assets received or held by licensed persons or registered institutions outside Hong Kong are subject to the applicable laws and regulations of the relevant overseas jurisdiction. These laws and regulations may differ from the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571) and the rules made thereunder. As a result, the corresponding client assets may not enjoy the same protection as those received or held in Hong Kong.</p>
							
							<h3 class="heading--section">Authorization for Re-Pledging Your Securities Collateral</h3>
							<p class="text--body">If you authorize a licensed person or registered institution to use your securities or securities collateral under a securities lending agreement, re-pledge your securities collateral to obtain financing, or deposit your securities collateral as collateral for fulfilling or discharging their settlement obligations and liabilities, there are certain risks involved.</p>
							<p class="text--body">If your securities or securities collateral are received or held by a licensed person or registered institution in Hong Kong, the above arrangements are only valid if you have given written consent. Additionally, unless you are a professional investor, your authorization must specify a valid period that does not exceed 12 months. If you are a professional investor, this restriction does not apply.</p>
							<p class="text--body">Moreover, if your licensed person or registered institution sends you a reminder at least 14 days before the expiry of the authorization and you do not object to the continuation of the authorization before it expires, the authorization will be deemed to have been renewed without your written consent.</p>
							<p class="text--body">There is currently no legal requirement for you to sign these authorizations. However, a licensed person or registered institution may require authorization, for example, to provide you with margin loans or to lend your securities or securities collateral to third parties or deposit them with third parties as collateral. The licensed person or registered institution should explain the purpose of exercising these powers to you.</p>
							<p class="text--body">If you sign one of these authorizations and your securities or securities collateral are lent to or deposited with third parties, those third parties will have a lien or charge on your securities or securities collateral. Although the licensed person or registered institution that lends or deposits your securities or securities collateral under your authorization is responsible to you, the misconduct of the licensed person or registered institution may result in losses to your securities or securities collateral.</p>
							<p class="text--body">Most licensed persons or registered institutions offer cash accounts that do not involve securities lending. If you do not need margin loans or do not want your securities or securities collateral to be lent or pledged, do not sign the above authorizations and request to open such cash accounts.</p>
							
							<h3 class="heading--section">Authorization to Hold Mail or Send Mail to Third Parties</h3>
							<p class="text--body">If you authorize a licensed person or registered institution to hold mail or send mail directly to third parties, you must collect all contract notes and account statements in a timely manner and carefully review them to ensure that any anomalies or errors are promptly identified.</p>
							
							<h3 class="heading--section">Margin Loans</h3>
							<p class="text--body">Before engaging in margin loans, you should carefully read this information and the terms of the margin loan agreement. 
							Through a margin loan, you can purchase eligible financial instruments using the loan provided by AFTT. If you choose to use a margin loan, the eligible financial instruments in your account will serve as collateral for the loan. Before using a margin loan, you should carefully consider your financial situation and risks and consult your independent professional advisor if necessary.</p>
							
							<h5 class="heading--5"><u><i>Margin Loans Involve Greater Market Risk</i></u></h5>
							<p class="text--body">Using a margin loan allows you to purchase more financial instruments than you would without the loan. Consequently, you will be more affected by price movements in the target financial instruments. If the target financial instruments depreciate, your potential losses will be greater.</p>
							
							<h5 class="heading--5"><u><i>You May Lose More Than Your Initial Margin Deposit</i></u></h5>
							<p class="text--body">When conducting margin trading, an initial margin deposit must be made in the form of cash or fully paid securities. A margin deposit is necessary because AFTT will not lend you the full value of the securities you wish to purchase. A margin loan allows you to purchase securities whose value exceeds your initial margin deposit. Therefore, you will be more vulnerable to fluctuations in the prices of the securities purchased. A decline in the value of the securities purchased may result in losses exceeding your initial margin deposit and may require you to deposit additional funds or collateral to avoid the forced sale of margin securities or other securities in your account.</p>
							
							<h5 class="heading--5"><u><i>Repledging</i></u></h5>
							<p class="text--body">Under the terms and conditions of the margin loan, AFTT has the right to sell, pledge, repledge, transfer, invest, use, commingle, or otherwise dispose of your margin securities and otherwise use any margin securities in its business. Default may result in the loss of your margin securities.</p>
							<p class="text--body"><i>If you fail to meet the margin requirements, AFTT has the right to liquidate or reduce positions in your account without further notice.</i></p>
							<p class="text--body">If you fail to meet the applicable margin requirements, AFTT has the right (but not the obligation) to liquidate or reduce different types of positions in your account and/or cancel any open orders without further notice, depending on whether your "margin utilization" ratio or "collateral utilization" ratio (or both) reaches or exceeds 100%.</p>
							
							<h5 class="heading--5"><u><i>You Are Always Responsible for Any Deficit in Your Account Balance</i></u></h5>
							<p class="text--body">You will always be fully responsible for any deficit in your account balance or interest charges. For example, even if AFTT exercises its rights to liquidate or reduce positions in your account, you will still be responsible for any deficit in your account balance.</p>
							
							<h5 class="heading--5"><u><i>You Have No Discretion in Liquidating Assets in the Event of a Margin Call</i></u></h5>
							<p class="text--body">In the event of a forced sale, AFTT will sell all of your securities (if you have opted for a full stop-loss) or proportionally sell part of your securities (if you have opted for a partial stop-loss). You will not have the right to decide which securities to sell, the quantity to be sold, or the order in which the securities are sold, nor will you have the right to request an extension of the margin call. Additionally, you will still be responsible for repaying the deficit in your account balance and the corresponding interest.</p>
							
							<h5 class="heading--5"><u><i>AFTT May Increase Applicable Margin Requirements at Any Time Without Notice</i></u></h5>
							<p class="text--body">AFTT may adjust any applicable margin requirements at any time (at its discretion), and such changes will take effect immediately without further notice. You are fully responsible for ensuring that your account always has sufficient collateral or funds to meet any applicable margin requirements.</p>
							
							<h3 class="heading--section">Margin Trading</h3>
							<p class="text--body">The risk of loss from financing transactions through the deposit of collateral can be substantial. You may incur losses that exceed the cash and any other assets you have deposited with the licensed person or registered institution as collateral. Market conditions may prevent the execution of contingent orders, such as "stop-loss" or "stop-limit" orders. You may be required to deposit additional margin or pay interest within a short period. If you fail to meet the required margin deposit or interest within the specified time, we may liquidate your collateral without your consent. Furthermore, you will still be responsible for repaying the deficit in your account balance and the corresponding interest. Therefore, carefully consider whether such financing arrangements are suitable for you based on your personal financial situation and investment objectives.</p>
							
							<h3 class="heading--section">Securities Lending</h3>
							<p class="text--body">Before participating in securities lending, you should carefully read this information and the terms of the securities lending agreement.</p>
							<p class="text--body">By participating in securities lending, you allow AFTT to borrow your securities under a title transfer, after which AFTT may lend them to third parties. However, you will continue to bear the market risk of any securities borrowed by AFTT (i.e., if the price of the securities decreases during the period when the securities are borrowed by AFTT, the value of the securities you receive at the termination/maturity of the loan will also decrease, and vice versa).</p>
							<p class="text--body">If AFTT borrows your securities, you may still choose to sell those securities at any time.</p>
							<p class="text--body">AFTT may not borrow any securities from your account, so you may not be entitled to any additional income from participating in securities lending. If AFTT borrows securities from you, the additional income you receive may fluctuate depending on the prevailing market conditions.</p>
							<p class="text--body">While your securities are lent out, you will not retain the voting rights and rights to attend shareholders' meetings (if applicable). When participating in securities lending, you cannot choose to lend only specific securities in your account to AFTT.</p>
							<p class="text--body">You should consult a tax advisor regarding any potential tax implications arising from participating in securities lending.</p>
							
							<h3 class="heading--section">Nasdaq-Amex Securities of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited</h3>
							<p class="text--body">Securities under the Nasdaq-Amex Pilot Program ("PP") are primarily intended for experienced investors. Before trading pilot project securities, you should consult a licensed person or registered institution and understand the pilot program. Please note that pilot project securities are not regulated on the Main Board or GEM of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.</p>
							
							<h3 class="heading--section">Precious Metals</h3>
							<p class="text--body">Trading in precious metals (including gold, silver, and other precious metals) can yield significant returns, particularly in margin trading, but it can also result in substantial losses exceeding the initial margin. Therefore, trading in precious metals is not suitable for everyone. Please note that the value of precious metals is influenced by many unpredictable global economic factors. If market conditions are unfavorable for your existing positions, we may require you to deposit additional margin funds temporarily to maintain your margin positions. If you do not deposit the required funds within the specified time, we may immediately close out all your existing margin positions, and you may be required to repay any resulting deficit in your trading account. In rapidly changing markets, placing contingent orders may not limit losses to the expected amount. Market conditions may prevent the execution of such orders. Therefore, you should seek independent financial advice to ensure that trading in precious metals is suitable for your financial situation.</p>
							
							<h3 class="heading--section">Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</h3>
							<p class="text--body">Most ETFs track a portfolio of assets to diversify investment risks. These funds typically aim to track the performance of a specific index, market sector, or asset class (e.g., stocks, bonds, or commodities). However, some ETFs may invest in stock index futures contracts and other derivatives. Compared to traditional securities, derivatives are more sensitive to market price movements due to their lower margin requirements and high leverage. Therefore, even small price fluctuations in derivatives can lead to significant losses (or gains) for ETFs. Additionally, some derivatives trades are conducted over-the-counter (OTC). OTC derivative markets are usually not regulated by government agencies, and participants in these markets are not required to engage in continuous market trading for the contracts they trade. Consequently, ETFs that engage in OTC derivative trades may face liquidity risks. If market makers stop performing their duties, investors may be unable to buy or sell the ETF. ETFs that do not have their underlying assets denominated in the base currency may also face exchange rate risks. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively affect the value of the underlying assets and the price of the ETF. Before trading, customers should carefully read the ETF's prospectus, ensure they understand how the fund operates, and make their own judgment about whether the product is suitable for them.</p>

							<h3 class="heading--section">Extended Trading Hours</h3>
							<p class="text--body">Before participating in extended trading hours on the U.S. securities market, you should consider the following points. <u>"Extended Trading Hours"</u> refers to (a) the <u>"Pre-Market Trading Session"</u> from 7:00 AM to 9:30 AM Eastern Time; (b) the <u>"Post-Market Trading Session"</u> from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM Eastern Time. <u>"Regular Trading Hours"</u> refer to the trading period from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern Time.</p>
							<strong>1. General Risks</strong>
							<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
							    <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em"><em>Lower Liquidity Risk</em>. Liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy and sell securities. Generally, the more orders in the market, the higher the liquidity. Liquidity is crucial because higher liquidity allows investors to buy and sell securities more easily, potentially resulting in more competitive transaction prices. Liquidity during extended trading hours may be lower than during regular trading hours. Therefore, the orders you place during extended trading hours may only be partially executed or not executed at all and may result in less favorable transaction prices.</li>
							    <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em"><em>Higher Volatility Risk</em>. Volatility refers to the price fluctuations experienced during securities trading. Generally, the higher the volatility of a security, the more significant its price fluctuations. Volatility during extended trading hours may be higher. As a result, your orders may only be partially executed or not executed at all. Compared to regular trading hours, the transaction prices you obtain during extended trading hours may also be less favorable.</li>
							    <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em"><em>Price Change Risk</em>. The transaction prices of securities during extended trading hours may not reflect the prices during regular trading hours. Therefore, compared to regular trading hours, the transaction prices you obtain during extended trading hours may be less favorable. Additionally, securities in an index or portfolio may not trade as regularly as during regular trading hours, or they may not trade at all. This may result in the prices during extended trading hours not reflecting the subsequent opening prices of those securities.</li>
							    <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em"><em>Disconnection Risk</em>. Depending on the extended trading hours system or the time of day, the prices displayed on one extended trading hours system may not reflect the transaction prices of the same securities on other extended trading hours systems operating simultaneously. Therefore, the prices you obtain on one extended trading hours system may be less favorable compared to the prices you obtain on other extended trading hours systems.</li>
							    <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em"><em>News Release Risk</em>. Generally, issuers release news announcements that may affect the prices of their securities after regular trading hours. Similarly, significant financial information is often released outside of regular trading hours. During extended trading hours, these announcements may be released during the trading session, and combined with lower liquidity and higher volatility risks, they may cause exaggerated and unsustainable impacts on securities prices.</li>
							    <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em"><em>Wider Spread Risk</em>. The spread refers to the difference between the bid and ask prices of a security. Lower liquidity and higher volatility during extended trading hours may result in a wider spread for specific securities.</li>
							</ol>
							<strong>2. Order Handling</strong>
							<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
							    <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em"><em>Limit Orders</em>. All existing limit orders submitted for eligible financial products, if the "Extended Hours" option has been enabled on the corresponding trade ticket, will continue to be executed during the pre-market trading session or post-market trading session. If any unexecuted limit orders remain after the following periods, unless canceled, expired, or otherwise directed by you, they will be handled as follows: (1) Pre-Market Trading Session: carried forward to the subsequent regular trading hours; (2) Regular Trading Session: carried forward to the subsequent post-market trading session; (3) Post-Market Trading Session: carried forward to the subsequent pre-market trading session.</li>
							    <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em"><em>Stop and Conditional Orders</em>. For financial products that can be traded during extended trading hours, stop and conditional orders will not be triggered by price updates received during the extended trading hours but will only be triggered by price updates of the relevant financial products during regular trading hours.</li>
							    <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em"><em>Corporate Actions</em>. We may, at our discretion, decide not to allow trading of certain financial products affected by corporate actions during extended trading hours unless all related orders and positions can be properly processed.</li>

							<strong>3. Margin Requirements</strong>
							<p style="margin-left: 1.0rem;">For financial products that can be traded during extended trading hours, price updates received during this period will affect the initial margin in your account but will not affect the maintenance margin. However, your margin utilization ratio may still change during extended trading hours due to trading activity (including trading of other financial products or currency fluctuations). If you reach or breach the margin requirements during extended trading hours, AFTT may not liquidate any or all contracts and margin positions for these financial products before regular trading hours but may immediately liquidate any other financial products during regular trading hours.</p>
							<strong>4. Account Barriers</strong>
							<p style="margin-left: 1.0rem;">For financial products that can be traded during extended trading hours, your account barriers will not be triggered by price updates received during the extended trading hours but will only be triggered by price updates for those financial products during regular trading hours.</p>
							<p class="text--body">Participating in extended trading hours means you expressly acknowledge and agree to the specific risks and rules associated with investing during extended trading hours. AFTT may not predict or describe all the unique trading risks that may arise during extended trading hours. Therefore, you agree that AFTT shall not be liable for any risks you assume by participating in extended trading hours, whether mentioned above or not.</p>
							<p class="text--body">If this risk warning conflicts with AFTT's general trading terms, the general trading terms shall prevail.</p>
							<p class="text--body">AFTT may notify you of the extended trading hours we will not quote, the amount limits we quote, or other conditions applicable to our quotes, or publish such information on the financial product trading platform, but any such notifications are not binding on us.</p>
							<p class="text--body">You expressly acknowledge and agree that whether or not you engage in extended trading hours, the price updates received during extended trading hours for financial products tradable during this period will affect the initial margin in your account, and this may impact or reduce your ability to open new positions or withdraw funds for any financial product. Additionally, you understand that extended trading hours may not be suitable for all investors, and you are fully responsible for implementing or adopting any investment decisions or trading strategies.</p>
							
							<h3 class="heading--section">Forex Touch Options (Applicable to Professional Investors)</h3>
							<p class="text--body">Forex Touch Options are a type of binary options where the payout has only two possible outcomes: either you receive the predetermined fixed amount when the event occurs on or before the expiry date, or you lose the amount invested in the option. Simply put, Touch Options are usually held until expiration under an "all or nothing" payout structure, based on a straightforward "yes" or "no" proposition: will the currency pair* touch the set price on or before the specific date? This differs from traditional forex options, which grant the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell a currency pair at a set price on or before a specific date.</p>
							<p class="text--body">When you trade Touch Options, the maximum loss is known. Depending on whether the position is a buy or sell, your account will fully reserve the premium or nominal/payout amount when trading Touch Options (whichever represents the maximum loss). This means the product cannot be traded on margin.</p>
							<p class="text--body">Whether Touch Options are regulated depends on their underlying asset. If the underlying asset of a binary option is traded over-the-counter (e.g., forex spot trading), it must be noted that the OTC market is largely unregulated, as it is decentralized, with trading conducted directly between two counterparties, and liquidity dispersed across different venues. Therefore, compared to the regulatory oversight and transparency of a regulated exchange, the oversight and transparency of the OTC market are significantly lower, while a regulated exchange is required to maintain a fair, orderly, and transparent market.</p>
							<p class="text--body">The tradable period for Touch Options ranges from 1 day to 12 months. Shorter-duration Touch Options carry higher risk, as investors may be affected by short-term volatility. Additionally, it can be challenging to consistently predict the performance of the underlying asset over a short period.</p>
							<p class="text--body">Unless you fully understand the fundamental aspects of Touch Options trading and the associated risks, you should not engage in such trading. By trading unregulated financial products, investors will not receive the protections provided by a regulatory framework, protections that only apply to regulated products.</p>
							<p class="text--body">*Available currency pairs include: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, EUR/GBP, USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, and AUD/USD.</p>
							<p class="text--body">For example:</p>
							<ul>
							   <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">If you purchase a Touch Option or a No-Touch Option, the maximum amount you could lose is the premium paid upfront (if the option "touches," you will receive the nominal/payout amount). You must be able to prepay this premium, which will be deducted from your account at the time of the trade, and from a margin perspective, the market value of the Touch Option position cannot be used to support any other existing or new open contracts as leverage.</li>
							   <li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">If you sell a No-Touch Option or Touch Option, you will receive the premium upfront (you retain the entire premium, but if the option "touches," you may have to pay the nominal/payout amount). The premium is credited to your account at the time of the trade, but the entire nominal/payout amount will be reserved from your account, and from a margin perspective, it cannot be used to support any other existing or new open contracts during the lifetime of the Touch Option.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<h3 class="heading--section">Contracts for Difference (Applicable to Professional Investors)</h3>
							<p class="text--body">A Contract for Difference (CFD) is an agreement between two parties to exchange the difference in value of a financial instrument or security from the time the contract is opened to the time it is closed. This product allows you to speculate on the future value movement of a particular asset (such as a stock). If your view is correct, you will profit from the difference in value (minus costs). If your view is incorrect, you must pay the corresponding difference in value (plus costs). Because the value of a CFD is linked to the underlying asset, its value depends on that asset. CFDs are always traded on margin (see the previous section on forex trading). CFDs are typically traded with AFTT as the counterparty, but some CFDs may be traded on a regulated market. However, prices always fluctuate with the price movements of the underlying product, which, in most cases, is traded on a regulated market. The price and liquidity of single stock CFDs reflect the price and liquidity of that stock on the exchange where it is traded, while index CFDs are OTC products, with their prices determined by AFTT based on the prices and liquidity of the underlying stocks, the futures market, estimated future dividends, interest rate effects, and other factors.</p>
							<p class="text--body">Please note that because CFDs are traded on margin, you may hold larger positions relative to your available funds at AFTT. Consequently, relatively small negative or positive fluctuations in the underlying financial instrument can have a significant impact on your investment, making the risks associated with CFD trading relatively high. Thus, even with relatively small margin deposits, the potential returns can be substantial. However, if the total risk of your margin trading exceeds your margin deposits, your losses could exceed your margin deposits.</p>
							<p class="text--body">CFD investments are generally considered a risky form of investment. If you have previously taken a conservative approach to investing, you may wish to seek further professional advice before considering an investment in any collective investment scheme. You must recognize that you could lose all of your investment.</p>
