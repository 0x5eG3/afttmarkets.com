							<p>What is an IPO?<br>
								An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is when a company first offers shares to public investors and gets listed on a stock exchange (e.g., Hong Kong Stock Exchange) for trading. Investors can subscribe to newly issued shares during the IPO subscription period. If allocated shares are successfully received, they can be purchased at the final offer price on the listing day. This process is commonly referred to as IPO subscription or "buying new shares".
							</p>
							<p>How to subscribe to IPOs through AFTT?<br>
								It’s very simple. First, you need to open an account with AFTT, then log in to our trading platform, fund your account, click on the IPO option, and subscribe to the shares.
							</p>
							<p>What is the IPO subscription financing interest rate?<br>
								During the IPO subscription period, AFTT offers up to 10x leverage and zero interest to enhance your purchasing power. Please note that every investment carries some risk. Before applying for IPO financing subscription, make sure to read and fully understand the prospectus and other IPO documents.</p>

								Opening an account with AFTT is very quick and easy: just fill out a simple online application form and verify your identity.
							</p>
							<p>What should I do after completing the account opening application?<br>
								After your account is approved, you will receive an email from AFTT with information on how to fund your account. Your AFTT account will be activated once the funds are credited. You can also fund your account immediately after submitting the application to expedite account activation.
							</p>

							<p>Where can I subscribe to new shares?<br>
								IPO subscriptions can be done on the AFTTTraderGO/AFTTInvestor App and the web-based trading platform.
							</p>
							<p>What subscription methods are available for IPOs?<br>
								AFTT's IPO subscription currently only supports financing subscriptions for Hong Kong stocks and does not support cash subscriptions. When you subscribe with financing, you need to check the corresponding leverage ratio for each IPO. AFTT offers up to 10x leverage and a zero-financing subscription interest rate. AFTT's IPO financing subscription service supports the subscription of a minimum of one lot of new shares.
							</p>
							<p>What is the subscription period for IPOs? When will the allocation results be announced after subscribing?<br>
								The subscription period for AFTT IPOs is as announced on the AFTT trading platform. The IPO subscription results will be announced according to the allocation results date listed in the prospectus or on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange website.
							</p>
							<p>When using financing to subscribe to IPOs, when do I need to top up the remaining financing amount after the allocation results are announced?<br>
								You need to top up the equivalent amount of the allocated shares to your account by 4 pm on the day the Hong Kong Stock Exchange announces the allocation results. If you do not top up the amount in time, AFTT will sell or dispose of the newly issued securities in your account at any time on the stock listing day.
							</p>
							<p>How can I view the prospectus?<br>
								You can check it on the official website of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The prospectus displayed on the AFTT trading platform is for reference only. In case of discrepancies, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange version shall prevail.
							</p>
							<p>What is AFTT's support for dark pools, Group A and Group B, and what is the maximum number of shares that can be financed?<br>
								AFTT's IPO subscription service currently only offers subscriptions for Group A Hong Kong public offerings and does not support dark pool subscriptions. For popular new shares, AFTT can provide up to 10x leverage, usually zero-interest financing for 10-15 lots, depending on the target.
							</p>
							<p>If I sell my Hong Kong stocks on the same day as the IPO subscription, can the funds be directly used for new share subscriptions? Does AFTT support collateralized subscriptions?<br>
								Funds credited can be directly used for new share subscriptions. AFTT does not support collateralized subscriptions.
							</p>
							<p>When using leverage to subscribe to IPOs, if the allocated shares' value is less than the client's used own funds, when will the excess amount be refunded? Can the refund be immediately used for other new share subscriptions?<br>
								AFTT will immediately refund the excess amount of the allocated shares to the client, which can be used immediately for other new share subscriptions.
							</p>
							<p>New share prices generally fluctuate more than other stocks, with more risks. Before buying new shares, investors should pay attention to the following five key factors:<br>
								Company Valuation: Company valuation, also known as enterprise valuation, refers to the intrinsic value of the company, including its assets and profitability. Generally, valuation is measured through past performance. When subscribing to an IPO, it can be challenging for investors to obtain all financial information about the company. In this case, investors can assess the company's future growth potential through its prospects and IPO popularity.
								<br>Company Shareholders: Investors should also pay attention to the company's shareholder structure to further understand the company's management, foundation, and strategy. If the company's shareholders are well-known institutions, this can increase the IPO's popularity and public confidence.
								<br>Company Business: Additionally, investors should consider whether the company's business is in a high-growth phase. Even if management is well-executed, if the overall business trend is weak, valuation growth potential may be limited.
								<br>Company Performance and Market Competitiveness: Investors should also consider the company's performance and market competitiveness to assess whether the company can sustain profitability. Although investors cannot fully grasp the company's financial situation before buying new shares, they can compare the company's current performance with its peers.
								<br>Market Trends: Finally, investors should pay attention to overall market trends. During an economic downturn, even if a company's performance is outstanding, it may struggle to grow its revenue and profits.</p>
