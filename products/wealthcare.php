                            <p>The primary reason for diversifying a portfolio is to help spread risk across different assets, sectors, industries, or regions. Different asset classes will react differently to fluctuations in financial markets, so diversification means your overall investment won't be overly reliant on any single asset.</p>
                            <p>For example, stock prices generally rise when bond prices fall. A mix of stocks and bonds will provide less volatility (fewer ups and downs) than investing in a single asset, making it more suitable for long-term passive investors.</p>
                            <p>Diversification is a crucial part of any risk management strategy and can help reduce investment risk while achieving your goals gradually. AFTT WealthCare offers diversified portfolios to help you achieve optimal investment returns based on your risk tolerance.</p>
