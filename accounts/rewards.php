							<p>If you're a new client, your initial account level will depend on your opening deposit. To qualify for an upgrade, you'll need to earn a specific number of reward points, depending on the level you wish to join. Your points are calculated based on the last three months and the current month's earnings, on a rolling basis. For example, any points earned in January will no longer count towards your rolling total starting May 1.</p>

In other words, if you continue to meet the rolling points criteria for your current level, your 12-month membership will continue to extend.

							<p>There are two ways to earn reward points through funding:</p>
							<p>1. Net Deposits in the First 30 Days</p>
							<p>As a new AFTT client, you'll earn reward points based on your net deposits during the first 30 days from when you first fund your AFTT account. Every Euro (or equivalent account currency) deposited will earn you 0.6 reward points. For example, if you deposit $250,000, you'll earn over 120,000 reward points, qualifying you for Platinum status. Similarly, if you deposit $1,250,000, you'll earn over 500,000 reward points, qualifying you for VIP status. If you withdraw funds, your points balance will decrease accordingly. We recalculate your reward points balance at the end of each day; if you withdraw funds, we'll update your points daily, allowing you to track your reward points balance regularly. When your AFTT account balance meets the upgrade requirement, your upgrade will be processed within two business days. Please note that during the first 30 days, we do not consider AuM totals (excluding net deposits and transferred securities) for reward points calculation.</p>
							<p>2. Securities Transfers in the First 30 Days</p>
							<p>As a new AFTT client, within 30 days of opening your account, you'll earn reward points based on the net value of securities transferred into your account. The reward points earned from transferring securities are equivalent to those earned from depositing funds, based on the value of the transferred positions. Every Euro (or equivalent account currency) transferred will earn you 0.6 reward points. For example, if you transfer $250,000 worth of securities, you'll earn over 120,000 reward points, qualifying you for Platinum status. Similarly, if you transfer $1,250,000, you'll earn over 500,000 reward points, qualifying you for VIP status. If you withdraw funds or transfer securities out of your account, your reward points balance will decrease accordingly. We recalculate your reward points balance at the end of each day; if you withdraw funds or transfer securities out, we'll update your points daily, allowing you to track your reward points balance regularly. When your AFTT account balance meets the upgrade requirement, your upgrade will be processed within two business days. Please note that during the first 30 days, we do not consider AuM totals (excluding net deposits and transferred securities) for reward points calculation.</p>
							<p>3. Subsequent Funds and AuM</p>
							<p>After the first 30 days, you can continue to earn points based on your account funds. However, as these funds may be converted from cash to positions, your reward points will depend on your average AuM total, rather than your cash balance. This total refers to your account's total value, including any deposits and held positions. Your reward points are calculated based on your monthly average AuM, and you'll receive points during the last two trading days of each month. Every Euro (or equivalent account currency) AuM earns 0.025 points. For example, if your average AuM is USD 10,000, you'll earn over 200 reward points each month. Please note that during the first 30 days after account opening, we do not include your AuM in points calculation. Instead, we calculate points based on the net deposits and transferred securities' value.</p>

Instead, you'll enter a 12-month grace period, during which you can continue to enjoy all the benefits of your current account level. During this time, you can collect enough reward points to meet the qualification criteria again. Once you meet the criteria again, your 12-month rolling membership will reset. We will only consider downgrading you if you consistently fail to meet the points criteria during the grace period.</p>
