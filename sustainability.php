                <h6>At AFTT, we believe that financial success and sustainability are closely linked. We are committed to helping clients make informed investment decisions to achieve their financial goals while making a positive, sustainable impact on the issues they care about. We strive to integrate Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors into our platforms, products, and services, and to promote sustainability in our business operations. We believe this will contribute to building a better future.</h6>
                <h6>In 2022, we launched our first sustainability strategy to ensure consistent focus on sustainability in our business, identify specific ways we want to measure progress, and drive meaningful actions across the company to address both short- and long-term goals. Since then, as our understanding of how AFTT impacts and addresses different ESG factors deepens, we refine this strategy every year.</h6>
                <h6>Our current global strategic drivers of sustainability aim to support our business strategy and goals in a meaningful way. Over time, our specific targets and progress metrics will continue to evolve, but our focus on the impact in these areas will remain consistent.</h6>
